Hi, I'm Ezra Low Chin Chau. I'm a [personal trainer](/certifications), and [nutrition coach](/certifications).

When I was 46 in early 2011, I found myself in poor health despite being moderately active and careful about my diet.
My experience in regaining my health taught me what worked, and ignited my my interest in learning more and in helping more people regain and maintain their ability to live actively. You can read more of my story on [this page](/mystory), and testimonies of some people I worked with [here](/testimonies).

I believe in living actively regardless of age, and in helping others do the same.

I provide coaching in fitness and nutrition, individually tailored to your needs.
If you want to:
* Be physically and mentally fit to interact actively with your family, friends and community
* Be able to travel and engage in active outdoor activities without many age-related restrictions
* Develop and maintain a healthy relationship with food, exercise, and your physcial condition

[Contact me](https://forms.gle/WsBVSzgSTPhMQDW1A){:target="_blank"} today for a free, no obligation consultation.

> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?  
You are not your own, for you were bought with a price.
So glorify God in your body.   --- 1 Corinthians 6:19-20
