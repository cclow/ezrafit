I’ve joined Chin Chau’s exercise group in April 2021 amidst the COVID restrictions.
Starting through Zoom before going on site after the restrictions were lifted. 

After my retirement in 2019, my main activities to improve my health is walking and running.
Joining Chin Chau’s group exercise programme helped me to develop my fitness to another level
with improvement to my overall muscle strength,
flexibility as well greater dietary awareness.
One key observation is that while we exercise as a group with each having different fitness levels,
Chin Chau is able to pay personal attention to correct our technique/posture and more importantly,
adapt each exercise to the different levels so that we are sufficiently challenged without getting any injury. 

I always look forward to his training sessions as it’s always very enjoyable
and motivating with a happy sense of achievement at the end of each session!
