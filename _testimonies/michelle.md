Weight issue and perception of beautiful weight (waistline) is always my constant struggle since young.
It is a merciless struggle in my pre-teen while coping with poor health however I broke through the cycle during my teenage hood with massive marching, uniform group activities and skipping meals to achieve the ideal weight of my perception.
Thinking it was over but motherhood and aging again bring me back to the cycle..

I had tried many ways such as slimming center, food replacement, slimming pills, crush diets, going to the weekly gym but nothing seem to be sustainable and pleasurable like my lifestyle until I get to know Ezra personally.

Our exercise regime started off with objectives to prepare graceful aging and focus to ensure our joints and mobility are good.
For all I know, I am too proud to imagine ageing comes with wheelchair and losing dignity to do what I use to do.
The objective was clearly laid down positively and no guilt nor embarrassment when I can't achieve the stretch or strength to carry out the workout.Â I started off with weekly pain (muscles aches) and gradually becomes a pleasure that I look forward to 'repair' the body from the desk bound mill worker syndrome!

Ezra is patience and never uses the lens of why I am not working harder on my own time or why am I indulging in empty calories.
He is subtle in his coaching style and helps me to learn new habit of eating right and to sustain the eating habit as part of my lifestyle.
In fact, we do share good food (still tasty healthy stuff!) and eating together after our workout.

I am still work in progress to increase my cardio exercise frequency; however, my lifestyle has changed.
I am more intentional to incorporate more steps in my daily activities, carry my groceries instead of wheeling them and climbing more steps than using lift.
Today, I can squat better than any of my colleagues, do lunges, split squad, has stronger muscles at areas that we most neglected and much fitter in mobility and strength.

It is my investment towards aging gracefully and Ezra has made it happened and sustainable for my journey!
