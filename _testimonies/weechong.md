Back in 2017 when I was 53 years old, I was “slightly” over-weight at a trim 105 kg with a size 42-inch waist. After the age of 30, I put on an average of 1.5 to 2 kg each year, despite been active and trying a lot of different diets. My health issues included high blood pressure of 145 over 95. Like a lot of my friends at that age, my philosophy in life back then was there’s nothing much we can do and just to let nature takes its course and live life to the fullest.
Fast forward to today and I have made tremendous improvement in both my weight and health issues. Recently, when I met some friends who hadn't seen me in a while, they couldn't help but notice the significant weight loss I had achieved. It was evident that a few of them even held a concern that I might be battling a serious illness, although they were too polite to inquire directly. I want to assure everyone that there is no need to worry.

The reason behind my transformation is quite straightforward. In early 2017, my childhood friend Chin Chau asked me out for breakfast. Breakfast soon became lunch and we spent 3 or 4 hours talking. Little did I know that this casual outing would turn into a transformative journey and be life-changing. Chin Chau spent a lot of time explaining his health and wellness programme. But back then, I was very resistant, I was too “busy” to exercise.

Let’s be honest – I was absolutely lazy! Thankfully, Chin Chau did not give up. Initially, it was just tweaking my diet by cutting sugar and reducing processed food and carbs. I was amazed that I lost 5kg in the 1st month! I was very motivated and started speaking with Chin Chau whenever we could. I discovered that there’s so much we have misunderstood on basic nutrition, exercise, even on the importance of sleep and overall wellness. I am happy to report that today, I have lost at least 35 kg and 11 inches off my waist, and my blood pressure is in the low range (110 over 70). 

I have never felt healthier or stronger in a long time. I am very glad and grateful that up to today, Chin Chau is still helping me and a small group of friends who joins him for calisthenics and weight training every week.
